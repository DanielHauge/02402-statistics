## a) 
There are 251 grades, the median will be the grade at 125 positon.
Can just count up to 125, and pick the group which the counting ended on. In this case, counting down, 34 at grade 12, 28 at grade 10, 43 at grade 7 and hitting 125 in grade 4. Meaning the median will be grade 4.


## b)
Quartiles are approx one forth. Each representing approx 62 grades. Again, can count up to that 62 grades. Countign from the lowest:
Grade 0 and -3 make up 65 grades, which means the lower quartile is 0.
grade 12 and 10 make up 62 grades, which is exactly at the cut off. the upper quartile is 10. Inter quartile range is then 10-0 = 10.
